# 3D Shirt Designer

This is a project I made to help better my skills with new technologies.

# Features
User-friendly Interface: The application provides a clean and intuitive interface for custoizing a t-shirt.

Upload custom images or logos for the user customization.

The AI function of this app is currently not working due to funding the AI. It should all be set up in the future for me to add this function. 
# How to Use
1. Open the web page in your preferred web browser.

2. Click on the "Customize It" button 

3. The tabs on the left of the screen will let the user be able to change the color of the shirt, Upload a file/image which can display as a small logo on the shirt or cover the shirt, and use AI to display anything on the shirt but currently this capability is not here.

4. On the bottom of the screen there are 2 option where the user can see the different styles of their logo on the shirt.
